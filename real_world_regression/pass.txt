It seems like there might be a conflict or an issue with the driver installation. Let's go through a detailed troubleshooting process to fix this:

### Step 1: Remove All CUDA and NVIDIA Driver Installations
Ensure that all CUDA and NVIDIA driver installations are completely removed to start fresh.

1. **Remove CUDA:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get --purge remove "*cublas*" "cuda*" "nsight*" "*nvidia*"
   ```

2. **Remove NVIDIA Drivers:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get --purge remove "*nvidia*"
   ```

### Step 2: Add NVIDIA Repository and Install Latest Driver
Add the NVIDIA repository to ensure you get the latest driver.

1. **Add the NVIDIA repository:**
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install the latest driver:**
   Check for the recommended driver version:
   ```bash
   ubuntu-drivers devices
   ```
   Install the recommended driver (replace `nvidia-driver-<version>` with the version recommended):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-<version>
   ```

3. **Reboot the system:**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

### Step 3: Install CUDA 11.7
1. **Download CUDA 11.7:**
   Download the CUDA 11.7 installer from the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.7.0-download-archive).

2. **Install CUDA 11.7:**
   Follow the installation instructions provided on the website. Ensure you select the option to install the driver if prompted.

### Step 4: Verify Installations
After installation and rebooting the system, verify both the driver and CUDA installation:

1. **Check NVIDIA driver:**
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```
   This should show the GPU details and the driver version.

2. **Check CUDA version:**
   ```bash
   nvcc --version
   ```
   This should show CUDA 11.7.

### Step 5: Check Environment Variables
Ensure that the environment variables are correctly set for CUDA 11.7:

1. **Edit your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:**
   ```bash
   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.7/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.7/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```

2. **Source the file to apply the changes:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Step 6: Check dmesg Logs
Check the system logs for any issues related to NVIDIA drivers:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i nvidia
```

### Additional Checks
- **BIOS Settings:** Ensure that the GPU is enabled in the BIOS settings.
- **Secure Boot:** If Secure Boot is enabled, try disabling it as it can interfere with NVIDIA drivers.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the conflict and have your system recognize the GPU properly. If you encounter any errors during these steps, please share the error messages for further assistance.
