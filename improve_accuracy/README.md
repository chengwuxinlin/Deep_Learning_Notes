## image classification
### data preprocessing

[data augmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation)
 ```
add noise
change the color and shape
flip and random crop(normally we skip vertical flip)
mixup: random add two data
cutmix: random crop datas and combine together
 ```

[data cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing)

### multiple models
 ```
train several model and weighted sum their output together

 ```


 ### training algorithm and dynamic learning rate 
 ```
Adam will not give you the best result but it is not so sensitive to various hyperparameters

 ```

## object detection
